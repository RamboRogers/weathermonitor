# Monitor Weather System 🌡️
This is a simple project to display the local weather on a monitor 💻 which continuously refreshes.  I use this on my families information center which presents in our kitchen/living room area.

This would probably be useful in a bar, or some other venue that would like to show the weather.  If you would like to show a slideshow I have a repo for that as well [https://github.com/RamboRogers/slideshow]. 

The Weather Montior is powered by the National Weather Service funded by US Federal Tax dollars; I don't know if this will work outside of the USA🌍.

    >_Note: The terminal window MUST remain open, it is a live application and weather cannot refresh without it!_



5. Update your location by editing the "getWeather.mjs" file by updating your longitude and latitude (you can get this off google maps).
